# FinalProjectCS3203
## Basic Description
Once running, this url should be able to display items in a menu that were added and created by the user (item number, item name, item description, item category, and item price). It should allow the user to add new items, as well as update and delete past items. In addition, the items in the menu can be sorted and displayed in many different ways, inlcluding by price, alphabetically by item name, or by category. 

All of the data is saved and written into a json file, which means the next time the user runs the program all of his or her data from the last time will automatically be saved and already reflected on the web page.

This system has two main components, which consists of the front end that is implemented using index.html web page and the back end that is implemented as an express.js server (server.js) implementing the REST APIs.
